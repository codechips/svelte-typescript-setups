> Test of [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) as a bundler for Svelte :8ball:


Code for my blog post [Is Vite currently the best bundler for Svelte?](https://codechips.me/svelte-with-vitejs-typescript-tailwind/).

## My Requirements

- It must be fast
- It must support Typescript
- It must support PostCSS
- It must produce small and efficient bundles
- It must produce correct sourcemaps for debugging
- It should support HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

## How to run

Clone the repo and run `pnpm i && pnpm start`.

To build do a `pnpm run build`

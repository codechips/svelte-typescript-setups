# svelte-webpack5-typescript

> Test of [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org) as a bundler for Svelte :snowflake:

Code for my blog post [Why Webpack 5 is the best bundler for Svelte](https://codechips.me/svelte-and-webpack-5/).

## My Requirements

- It must be fast
- It must support Typescript
- It must support PostCSS
- It must produce small and efficient bundles
- It must produce correct sourcemaps for debugging
- It should support HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

## How to run

Clone the repo and run `pnpm i && pnpm start`.

To build do a `pnpm build` and to analyze bundle `pnpm build:analyze`.

## There is more!
